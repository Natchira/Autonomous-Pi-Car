# Autonomous Pi Car: Integration of Deep Learning Models for Self-Driving

This repository contains the implementation and experiment results from the project  
**"Autonomous Pi Car: Integration of Deep Learning Models for Self-Driving"**

---

## Project Overview

This research applied **supervised deep learning techniques** to the **SunFounder PiCar-V Kit V2**, demonstrating a fully autonomous driving pipeline on a Raspberry Piâ€“based platform.

We developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model with **multi-output regression**, enabling the car to predict both:
- **Steering angle** (for directional control)
- **Speed value** (for throttle control)

This joint prediction allows for **smooth and real-time navigation** without manual input.
